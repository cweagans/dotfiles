# dotfiles

This is how I set up a system to my liking. I mostly run macOS, but there will be some tweaks over time to set up a minimal Linux environment (e.g. a shared hosting account or similar) to make it work in a familiar way.


## Installation

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cweagans/dotfiles/HEAD/remote_install.sh)"
```


## Support

Things I can do (open an issue for these things):

* Answer specific questions about how something works or why something was done the way it was.
* Point you toward relevant documentation.
* Make specific improvements (for instance, if something was broken for you and you figure out how to fix it, let me know and I'll incorporate your fix).

Things I probably can't/won't do:

* Do in-depth troubleshooting on your machine.
* Add features that are specific to your environment.
* Switch text editors, mail clients, programming language, dotfile management tool, or other similar changes.


## Uninstall

idk reload your machine or something.
